# traffic-mapping
### NOTE: The maps do not show up in my notebook on Github. To see the maps, go to: https://ruer98.github.io/datascience/traffic.html

This notebook shows my exploration of traffic patterns in Travis County. I use a dataset of traffic incidents from data.austintexas.gov and the folium library to create several maps as well as animated heatmaps of traffic to unearth patterns in accidents where I live.

I feature engineer date and time features, explore traffic types, and clean the data before mapping. I then create a map of individual incidents, cluster map, and various animated heatmaps based on month, day of the week, and hour of the day to develop insights.
