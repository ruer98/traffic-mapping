# traffic-mapping

NOTE: The animated heatmap code I use is now outdated

This notebook shows my exploration of traffic patterns in Travis County. I use a dataset of traffic incidents from data.austintexas.gov and folium to create several maps as well as animated heatmaps of traffic to unearth patterns in accidents where I live.
